"Friends"
(from The Angry Birds Movie)

There's a moment in this journey that I gave up
My boots just couldn't walk another mile
And that cloud above me had no silver lining
I couldn't buy a break with my last dime

Oh but when I saw you standing in the corner
I'd never thought that you would have my back
But then we rolled in like the thunder and the lightning
Threw some punches then we had a laugh

Just some roughed up desperados
Hanging tough through thick and thin
Kicking up dust wherever we go
I can see that you and me are gonna be friends

Who'd thought we'd wind up here together?
It's crazy that we're standing side by side
Fighting just like two birds of a feather
Who's gonna tell us now that we can't fly?

Just some roughed up desperados
Hanging tough through thick and thin
Kicking up dust wherever we go
And I can see that you and me are gonna be friends
To the end you and me are gonna be friends

Yeah, here we go

Hey, hey you and me
Different as different can be
You like to rock, I like to roll
You take the high, I'll take the low
Woah, woah-oh, woah-oh

Just some roughed up desperadoes
Hanging tough through thick and thin
Kicking up dust wherever we go
I can see that you and me are gonna be friends
To the end you and me are gonna be friends
And I can see that you and me are gonna be friends, yeah
